* What is Ahungry Tactics?
Ahungry Tactics is a free to play open source tactics game based on
game aspects from some of my favorite games in the past (Final Fantasy
Tactics, Magic The Gathering, and MMORPGs) that is played in your
web browser.

** What's the status of it currently?
Ahungry Tactics is still in development, however many aspects of the game
are currently in a working/finished state, such as:

- Animations
- Levels
- Card handling (trading/losing/gaining cards)
- Multiplayer
  
** How does it work?
Ahungry Tactics is done through HTML5 and Javascript on the front end 
(tapping into the power of node.js, socket.io and my own custom javascript
code.

On the back end, the game makes use of the powerful Common Lisp programming
language, using socket.io's node.js server to link the front end to the back.

** What's to come?
In the future, I will work on adding new development tips on how to implement
your own HTML5/javascript game, as well as development steps and discuss
some of the things I have implemented.
